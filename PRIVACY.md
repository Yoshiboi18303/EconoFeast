## What do we collect?

We collect the following:

- Your Discord user ID
- Your Discord guild ID

And that's about it.

## Why do we collect this data?

### If you're a user

We collect this data to create new documents in our database, as well as ensure you can use all economy commands of the bot

### If you're a guild owner

Your guild ID data is used to save log channel IDs so you can get the latest announcements from the owner _(if opted-in)_, as well as for stuff like the Language Filter _(to filter out bad words used in the bot)_, etc.

## How your data is used

Your data is used for all interactions with the database _(see **[Who else can see my data?](#can-anybody-else-see-my-data)**)_

## Can anyone else see my data?

Your data may be accessible to the database host (Supabase).

View their **[Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy)** to see how they handle your data.

## Is my data safe?

It should be, it is safely put into a Supabase project where no one can access the data.

You should make sure to check Supabase's **[Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy)** to see how they handle your data.

## Contact Info

### Yoshiboi18303

- **[Email (slow response time)](mailto:yoshiboi18303.t@gmail.com)**
- **[Discord (faster response time)](https://discord.gg/53DZc5SWue)**

## Data Deletion

Your data is able to be deleted by request. Just contact one of the developers from the **[Contact Info](#contact-info)** section with this template to make it easier:

### Email (slow response time)

- **Subject:** Data deletion request

### Discord (faster response time)

- **Add this header to your message:** `# Data Deletion Request`

You will have new data assigned to the database if someone tries to interact with you.

## Opt-out Info

### If you're a user

You can explicitly opt-out of the bot entirely contacting one of the devs listed in the **Contact Info** section,
putting this in your message for example: "I no longer want my data associated with this bot"

Your ID will then be added to a list of IDs of people who have opt-ed out of the bot as well as your current data getting deleted, and no one else can access or create data for you.

#### Note

If any developers add your data to the database when you've opt-ed out, rest assured your data will be deleted.

Additionally, the person who added your data back will be **punished** due to an invasion of privacy.

### If you're a guild owner

You cannot opt-out of the bot as a guild owner, at least at this point in time.

**This can change in the future though, so be on the lookout!**

## Ending Note

**Guild owners are encouraged to opt-in to the announcements _(by setting your `logChannelId`)_ to be the first to know when this Privacy Policy changes!**
