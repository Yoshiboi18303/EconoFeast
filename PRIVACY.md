Your data may be accessible to the database host (Supabase).

## Data Deletion

Your data is able to be deleted by request. Just contact one of the developers from the **[Contact Info](#contact-info)** section with this template to make it easier:

### Email (slow response time)

- **Subject:** Data deletion request

### Discord (faster response time)

- **Add this header to your message:** `# Data Deletion Request`

You will have new data assigned to the database if someone tries to interact with you.

However you can explicitly opt-out of the bot entirely by saying this for example: "I no longer want my data associated with this bot"

Your ID will then be added to a list of IDs of people who have opt-ed out of the bot, and no one else can access or create data for you.
